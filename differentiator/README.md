# differentiator

This programm is able to differentiate simple examples. 
Firstly it reads an example from file. So it has it's own parser with tree structure which renders the example to a tree. 
Then it differentiate the expression by modifying the tree. You can see interesting visualisation of this process in graph.dot file.

To see it in work make three simple steps:
  1. Clone the repo.
  2. Open the cloned repo in command line.
  3. Write 'make' in console.
